# resumecraft
This app was made to help me learn more about MongoDB databases and connecting them to a simple react application. It allows you to create a new user and enter relevent information for a resume. Users can then choose a resume template to use that will be filled out with their information and print the resume. 

You may create an account or feel free to use the one below that has information already entered in if you just want to look around! 

User: RCTest

Thank you!
